# Fibonacci Sequence Calculation

## Description

This project contains a function named `fib` that calculates the Fibonacci number at a specified position in the Fibonacci sequence using a loop. The Fibonacci sequence starts with the first two numbers as 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The first several numbers in the sequence are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, etc.

The function takes a positive integer parameter and returns the Fibonacci number at that position in the sequence. For example:

- `fib(1)` returns `1`
- `fib(3)` returns `2`
- `fib(10)` returns `55`

The function must use a loop to calculate the value and cannot use recursion or the golden ratio formula. This implementation is provided in three programming languages: **R**, **SAS**, and **Python**.
